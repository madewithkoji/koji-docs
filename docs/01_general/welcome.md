# Welcome to the Koji documentation

**Koji** is an app development platform that lets anyone create apps and games. Find something you like, remix it, and share it with the world.

The documentation is heavily work in progress. If you would like to contribute, or have 
questions or issues, visit the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/madewithkoji/koji-docs). You can make a pull request to edit any documentation section, or even add new ones!

## Getting Started

## Creating a file

In the project sidebar:
1. Click on the ➕ icon on the sidebar or while hovering over any folder.
2. Click **New file** and enter the path and file name of the file you want to create. ex: `/myfile.txt`
3. Click **Create file**

> ☝
> If your path includes a directory that does not exist, the directory will be created. ex: `/new_dir/new_file.txt` (`new_dir` will be created for you).

You can also create a file using your terminal.  
```sh
touch my_new_file.txt
```

## Creating a folder

Currently, this is not possible. However, you can still create a folder by either:

1. Following the steps to creating a file, but for the path you include the directory you want to be created.
2. Use the terminal
```sh
mkdir my_new_dir
```

## Uploading a file
Currently, this is not possible. However, you can get files into your project in the terminal using either `git` or `wget`

**git**:
```sh
git fetch remote_with_my_changes
```

**wget**:
```sh
wget url_to_my_file
```

## Downloading your files
Currently, this is not possible. However, as Koji uses `git` for version control, you can use `git` to clone your project locally.

1. Print your remote origin by running the following in your local terminal:
```sh
git ls-remote
```
2. Goto **Settings** -> **Development**.
3. Copy the **Remote Repository** URL, and then run:
```sh
git clone <URL>
```

## Adding VCCs to your app
Visual Custom Controls help non-technical creators remix apps, they are just `JSON` files that the editor exposes to achieve this purpose. Although it is entirely possible for you to load them per your needs, we provide an npm package called `koji-tools` to handle this conveniently. 

1. First, install `koji-tools`.
```sh
npm install --save koji-tools
```
2. Then use koji-tools like the following:
```js
import Koji from 'koji-tools';

Koji.pageLoad();
const config = Koji.config;

// On any change, update the config
Koji.on('change', (scope, key, value) => {
    config[scope][key] = value;
});
```
For more info on how to use koji-tools, checkout the koji-tools github [docs](https://github.com/madewithkoji/koji-tools/blob/master/README.md)
